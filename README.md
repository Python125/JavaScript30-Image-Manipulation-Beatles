This project served as a practical exercise to reinforce my JavaScript knowledge and explore DOM manipulation. Following a tutorial from Wes Bos' JavaScript30 series, I created an interactive image manipulation tool. By combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I implemented features such as dynamic image resizing, color changes, and grayscale effects using range inputs and color pickers. This project solidified my understanding of getElementById and addEventListener while introducing me to new possibilities within JavaScript.
